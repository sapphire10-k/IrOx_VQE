# Iridium Oxide ASE

This repository contains an open-source, reproducible workflow for constructing, analysing,
and reducing atomistic models of IrO₂ electrocatalyst surfaces using the Atomic Simulation
Environment (ASE).

The project is designed to support comparative surface science studies, hypothesis
generation for operando experiments (e.g. AP-XPS / AP-XAS), and model reduction for
hybrid classical–quantum simulation workflows.

While the current focus is IrO₂ and hydrogen adsorption intermediates, the workflow is
deliberately modular and extensible to other materials systems and physics-driven
comparative studies.

Preprint DOI: <https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-9495573/v1>  
Code archive DOI: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19491027>

## Scientific Scope

The workflow supports:

- Automated generation of IrO₂ slab models and adsorption configurations
- Geometry optimisation using semi-empirical and first-principles backends
- Systematic comparison of surface-bound intermediates across sites and coverages
- Extraction of chemically meaningful active subspaces
- Reduction of *ab initio* Hamiltonians for downstream classical and quantum simulations
- Benchmarking and validation against experimental observables

The pipeline is intended to bridge atomistic simulation, reduced-order modelling,
and emerging quantum algorithms in a single reproducible framework.

---

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sapphire10-k/IrOx_VQE
cd IrOx_VQE
```

---

### Create a Local Environment

Using conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Or with pip:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

---

## Running Locally

An end-to-end example of the IrO₂ H* adsorption workflow is provided in:

```text
examples/iro2_h_star_o69/
```

This example executes the full workflow via a shell script that orchestrates
the individual Python stages in the correct order.

### Run the Workflow

```bash
cd examples/iro2_h_star_o69
bash run_all.sh
```

---

## Workflow Orchestration Philosophy

The workflow is intentionally **not** driven by a single monolithic Python script.

Instead, `run_all.sh` acts as a lightweight orchestration layer that:

- Executes each workflow stage explicitly
- Preserves intermediate outputs for inspection and debugging
- Makes execution order transparent and reproducible
- Allows individual stages to be rerun independently
- Enables substitution of methods or backends without modifying core scripts

This design reflects the exploratory and comparative nature of atomistic
surface-science workflows.

Users extending the workflow to new surface states, adsorbates, or materials systems
are encouraged to copy and adapt the example `run_all.sh` scripts rather than invoking
internal scripts individually.

---

## Manual Workflow Design

The repository intentionally preserves a semi-manual workflow structure.

Rather than hiding all execution logic behind opaque automation layers, the project
prioritises:

- Transparency of simulation stages
- Inspectability of intermediate artefacts
- Explicit execution order
- Ease of debugging
- Scientific reproducibility
- Flexible substitution of computational methods

This approach is particularly valuable for:

- Comparative surface studies
- Active-space experimentation
- Benchmark generation
- Exploratory adsorption analysis
- Hybrid classical–quantum workflows

Intermediate files are considered scientifically meaningful outputs rather than
temporary artefacts.

---

## Continuous Integration and Cloud Workflows

The repository runs nine GitHub Actions workflows. Alongside CI (tests on every
push and pull request), the scientific stages themselves run as manually
triggered, reproducible cloud jobs: quantum cluster extraction, fermionic and
qubit Hamiltonian export, exact diagonalisation from an exported Hamiltonian,
xTB orbital analysis on extracted clusters, QE input generation, and the
canonical end-to-end example (`run_all.sh`).

Run tests locally:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

CI validation is intended to ensure workflow stability while preserving the
modular and exploratory nature of the repository.

---

## Reproducibility and Development Status

Initial IrO₂ slab construction and baseline relaxation were performed using
Quantum ESPRESSO prior to ASE-based automation and analysis.

The workflow is under active development.

### `main` branch

Contains:

- Stable examples
- Documentation
- Tested reference scripts
- Reproducible baseline workflows

### `development` branch

Contains:

- Full end-to-end benchmark generation pipeline
- Active-space selection workflows
- Hamiltonian reduction workflows
- Experimental comparative pipelines

Versioned releases will be used to tag fully reproducible benchmark states.
